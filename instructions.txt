SpaceInvaders: How to Run

Controls:
left: left
right: right
space: shoot

First, ensure that the core.jar is in the build path of the project.

Next, run src/server/GameServer.java as a Java Application.
The window will now display the game world with six enemy ships.
When clients connect, the mothership will show on bottom of the screen.
The GameServer accepts no user input.

Next, run src/client/ClientWorld.java as a Java Application.
Move the character around on the screen with left and right to dodge projectiles.
Shoot projectiles with the space bar.
Win the game by killing all enemy ships without losing all HP.

In order to demonstrate scripting, go to the src/scripting package.
move_enemy.js will allow changing of the speed at which the enemies travel.
move_mothership.js will allow changing of the speed at which the mothership travels.
move_projectile.js will allow changing of the speed at which the projectiles travels.
For example, if you want to change the projectile speed, change the value added to obj.y in move_projectile.js.
